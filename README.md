Blocitoff is a back-end application that allows users to create functional check-lists. I used Devise authorization to allow for multiple authenticated users, as well as Bootstrap for a more appealing UI. Each checklist item is listed in chronological order, and users are able to "check-off" items once complete. I utilized the distance_of_time_in_words helper to display a time stamp. I created a rake task that deletes all items that exceed even days to prevent checklists from becoming too large (and to hold users accountable to their intended tasks!)
